# cacophony

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/centromere/cacophony.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/centromere/cacophony)
[![Haskell](http://b.repl.ca/v1/language-haskell-blue.png)](http://www.haskell.org)

This library implements the [Noise](https://noiseprotocol.org) protocol.

## Basic Usage

1. Import the modules for the kind of handshake you'd like to use.

   For example, if you want to use `Noise_IK_25519_AESGCM_SHA256`, your imports would be:

   ```haskell
   import Crypto.Noise
   import Crypto.Noise.Cipher.AESGCM
   import Crypto.Noise.DH -- Used to generate and manipulate keys
   import Crypto.Noise.DH.Curve25519
   import Crypto.Noise.Hash.SHA256
   import Crypto.Noise.HandshakePatterns (noiseIK)
   ```

2. Set the handshake parameters.

   Ensure that you provide the keys which are required by the handshake pattern you choose. For example,
   the `Noise_IK` pattern requires that the initiator provides a local static key and a remote static key,
   while the responder is only responsible for a local static key. You can use `defaultHandshakeOpts` to
   return a default set of options in which all keys are set to `Nothing`. The initiator must set a
   local ephemeral key for all handshake patterns. The responder must set a local ephemeral key for all
   interactive (i.e. not one-way) patterns.

   ```haskell
   -- Initiator
   localEphemeralKey <- dhGenKey :: IO (KeyPair Curve25519)

   let dho = defaultHandshakeOpts InitiatorRole "prologue" :: HandshakeOpts Curve25519
       iho = setLocalStatic      (Just localStaticKey)
             . setLocalEphemeral (Just localEphemeralKey)
             . setRemoteStatic   (Just remoteStaticKey) -- communicated out-of-band
             $ dho

   -- Responder
   localEphemeralKey <- dhGenKey :: IO (KeyPair Curve25519)

   let dho = defaultHandshakeOpts ResponderRole "prologue" :: HandshakeOpts Curve25519
       rho = setLocalStatic      (Just localStaticKey)
             . setLocalEphemeral (Just localEphemeralKey)
             $ dho
   ```

3. Create the Noise state.

   ```haskell
   -- Initiator
   let ins = noiseState iho noiseIK :: NoiseState AESGCM Curve25519 SHA256

   -- Responder
   let rns = noiseState rho noiseIK :: NoiseState AESGCM Curve25519 SHA256
   ```

4. Send and receive messages.

   ```haskell
   -- Initiator
   let writeResult = writeMessage "They must find it difficult -- those who have taken authority as the truth, rather than truth as the authority." ins
   case writeResult of
     NoiseResultMessage ciphertext ins' -> ...
     NoiseResultNeedPSK   _ -> error "something terrible happened" -- will never happen in Noise_IK
     NoiseResultException _ -> error "something terrible happened"

   -- Responder
   let readResult = readMessage ciphertext rns
   case readResult of
     NoiseResultMessage plaintext rns' -> ...
     NoiseResultNeedPSK   _ -> error "something terrible happened"
     NoiseResultException _ -> error "something terrible happened"
   ```

   **Ensure that you never re-use a NoiseState to send more than one message.**

   Decrypted messages are stored internally as `ScrubbedBytes` and will be wiped from memory when they are
   destroyed.

### Helper Functions

The following functions are found in `Crypto.Noise.DH` and are used to manipulate keys:

  * `dhGenKey` -- Generate a fresh (private, public) key pair
  * `dhPubToBytes` -- Convert a public key to `ScrubbedBytes`
  * `dhBytesToPub` -- Convert `ScrubbedBytes` to a public key
  * `dhSecToBytes` -- Convert a private key to `ScrubbedBytes`
  * `dhBytesToPair` -- Convert `ScrubbedBytes` to a (private, public) key pair

The following functions are found in `Crypto.Noise`:

  * `remoteStaticKey` -- For handshake patterns where the remote party's static key is transmitted, this function
    can be used to retrieve it. This allows for the creation of public key-based access-control lists.

  * `handshakeComplete` -- Returns `True` if the handshake is complete.

  * `processPSKs` -- This function repeatedly applies PSKs to a NoiseState until the list of PSKs becomes empty
    or the handshake pattern stops asking for PSKs.

  * `handshakeHash` -- Retrieves the `h` value associated with the conversation's SymmetricState. This value is
    intended to be used for channel binding. For example, the initiator might cryptographically sign this value
    as part of some higher-level authentication scheme. See section 11.2 of the protocol for details.

  * `rekeySending` and `rekeyReceiving` -- Rekeys the given NoiseState according to section 11.3 of the protocol.

## Vectors

Test vectors can be generated and verified using the `vectors` program. It accepts no arguments. When run,
it will check for the existence of `vectors/cacophony.txt` within the current working directory. If it is not
found, it is generated. If it is found, it is verified. All files within the `vectors/` directory (regardless
of their name) are also verified. Note that this program can only generate and verify vectors whose handshake
patterns are pre-defined in this library.

## Custom Handshakes

If the built-in handshake patterns are insufficient for your application, you can define your own. Note that
this should be done with care.

Example:

```haskell
noiseFOOpsk0 :: HandshakePattern
noiseFOOpsk0 = handshakePattern "FOOpsk0" $
  preInitiator s            *>
  preResponder s            *>
  initiator (psk *> e *> es *> ss) *>
  responder (e *> ee *> se)
```

## Handshake Validation

`HandshakePattern`s can be validated for compliance as described in sections 7.1 and 9.3 of the protocol:

```
λ> let noiseBAD = handshakePattern "BAD" $ preResponder ss *> initiator (e *> se *> e)
[DHInPreMsg (0,0),InitMultipleETokens (1,2),InitSecretNotRandom (1,3)]

λ> validateHandshakePattern noiseKKpsk0
[]
```

See the `Crypto.Noise.Validation` module for details.

## Tools

### format-vectors.py

Vectors generated by the vector program are formatted as minified JSON. This python script takes the path
to a vector file as an argument and reformats it so that it conforms to
[the style](https://github.com/noiseprotocol/noise_wiki/wiki/Test-vectors) specified on the Noise Wiki.

### noise-repl

This program acts as a kind of REPL for Noise messages. It supports sending and receiving messages via UDP
or via a pipe to a shell command.

All messages transmitted via a pipe are expected to be prepended by a two byte big-endian length.
